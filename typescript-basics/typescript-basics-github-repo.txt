This is my typescript basics repository, in this folder index.html page is a youtube themed page I thought to append console data to the index page
and I tried a lot to do that but couldn`t do. I guess I need to learn more about typescript to do it.

As per assignment I created Youtube class and Facebook class,
All the properties of youtube and facebook are stored in an object by calling with methods/functions of class and shown on console.
