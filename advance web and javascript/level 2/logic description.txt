Problem statement one : converting javascript to es6
    I changed both check login normal function and the bubble sort normal function with es6 arrow functions

    checklogin : here I also used default parameters i.e, all users data values in array.
                 I have passed email and password to this function and checked with all users data and showing the output in alert box.
    bubble sort : here I passed a array with random numbers to bubble sort ascending function and bubble sort descending function.
                  I have showed the output in alert box.

    Please see the demo in javascript_to_es6.html file in javascript_to_es6 folder provided.

Problem statement two :

    1. Passing season number and episode number to es6 arrow function called season_episode_numbers function with default parameter season_data to the called function.
       using ajax and for of loop validated with each and every episode data and shown the response accordingly.

    2. Passing as many number of episode ids separated by commas to the input field and using jquery we took that complete string and converted into array then after removed
       duplicate numbers and stored final episode numbers in the an array and passed that array to episode_id_info which is also a es6 arrow function with default parameter
       season_data url, here we used for in and for of loops to validate with that array values and showed the response appropriately.

    3. Here we searched with episode name and passed that episode name to the es6 arrow function with default parameter season_data url,
       we used for of loop to validate and shown proper response.
