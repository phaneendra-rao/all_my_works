Logic of my code index.html :
   I have used EasyAutocomplete plugin to autocomplete the search field while typing, in index.html file there is only one search field and get info button,
   just we need to search by name of pokemon or weakness of pokemon in that search field,
   while typing we`ll get dropdown there itself then select that particular name and press get info button, according to name or weakness we`ll get info of that pokemon,

Logic of my code custom.js :

Initially all the names of pokemon and weaknesses of pokemon will be stored in one array using with that array we`ll use easyautocomplete plugin to display dropdown names and weaknesses of pokemon while typing in search field,

the value which we are taking from that search field is going to pass as name parameter or weakness parameter to following created functions,

   I created three functions one for pokemon details, one for pokemon next evolution and one for pokemon weaknesses,

   we are passing the name parameter to pokemon details and pokemon next evolution so that we`ll get some response through that pokemon json url,
   using forloops we validate and get particular pokemon information and displaying in proper manner.

   we can also pass weakness parameter to pokemon weaknesses function and did the same procedure for this function too.
